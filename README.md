# Advent of Code 2024

This year I'm using XSLT and DITA.

Results on
[Github pages](https://arkadianriver.github.io/AoC-2024),

Full source in `./src/xsl`, kicked off with the `build`
command, which runs dita with the installed plugin that
runs Ant as a pre-processing step to run the XSLT code to produce
the answer along with text in DITA, then transformed to HTML.
How's that for a run-on sentence (kind of like these densely
packed XSLT/XPath 3 solutions, I'm discovering).
