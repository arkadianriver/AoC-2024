	<p class="p">Now that I'm working full-time with XSLT, I'd like to use it to solve this year's challenges. I need the practice, so let's see
	how far I can take this language. I'm certain I'll need lots of help and will most likely get stumped more often than not.</p>
	<p class="p">Michael Kay has said that now with 3.0, XSLT is a complete language, and that it can be used to solve most any problem.
	To me, however, the language seems to prioritize keeping itself as pure and functional as possible over actual practical utility.
	For example, I recently needed to keep a running total while operating on numerous documents. What would be a trivial increment of a
	global variable in any other language requires carrying that parameter through multiple layers of recursion in XSLT. It's ridiculous.
	Nevertheless, I'll try real hard to overcome my practiced paradigms and learn something new.</p>
	<p class="p">Last year I found time to only do one puzzle, spending more time establishing a consistent Python framework than actually
	solving the Advent puzzles. And then I got busy with work. This year, I already spent over 4 hours doing the same with this
	DITA/XSLT setup, and here on the 14 December, this weekend free time is already half over, with just as much work to catch
	up on. We'll see how far I get. Here goes ...</p>
