            <p class="p">To pair the smallest number in the left list with the smallest number in the right,
							sort the two lists, keeping duplicates.</p>
            <p class="p">Then, to find the total distances between pairs, simply subtract one from another and get absolute value
							(in case negative), then sum.</p>
            <p class="p">How in XSLT. Oh, geez.</p>
            <p class="p">Given the lists are in the same file, side-by-side, let's do this:</p>
            <ol class="ol">
               <li class="li">Create two node variables, each by:
									<ol class="ol" type="a">
                     <li class="li">Reading in the file, line-by-line, grabbing whichever side this variable represents.</li>
                     <li class="li">Perhaps do it in an XPATH 3 way, sorting and assigning to a single sequence as we go. We'll see.</li>
                  </ol>
               </li>
               <li class="li">Now that we have two sorted lists of nodes of the same length, to keep a running total, we need to do that
									recursive business. Call a recursive template that takes sum as param, and the base case is
									to print the sum. Each recursive calls itself on the following-sibling::*[1] with the $sum + $calculated-distance.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="p">I think that'll do it, let's go!</p>

            <p class="p">Okay, this part is weird. I don't know what it actually solves, but I'm to take every number in the left list,
							count how often it appears in the right list, and multiply the number by how often it's in the right list, Then move
							onto the next left list number, adding all the products together.</p>
            <p class="p">I know what it's testing, how to make the right list a hash lookup table rather than running through it every time.
							Hmm. I think this time, I'll build a node-tree of the right-list and use that as the lookup.
							Not sure how under the covers XSLT optimizes the lookup of matching nodes, but ....</p>
